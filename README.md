# github-notes

In the video the funny sir taught us 4 things which are
* git
  Git is basically a version control, its the application on the running versions, it can be anywhere like a laotop etc.
* github
  But what sets github apart from its a web sever kind of, the way he explains it is how it runs git behind the scenes. A place where you can make projects with the version contro in it.
* repo
  Github Repo is a word for project, within the repo it has files you can add and work with it, when naming the repo, when you add a space like "david project" it will automatically add a dash instead of a space like "david-project" within the repo you can view history but ill get to that in comit
* comit
In comit it means like a save button, so when you click comit it will save the new code. But what makes it so helpful you update like any other but you can view history and see what code got added kr what code got removed.You can add notes when updating the comit so it become helpful to be in task or easier to track what are the changes. In the video it shows a bunch of number, its called a "comit hash" where its like a identifier for the code you changed, added or delete.
